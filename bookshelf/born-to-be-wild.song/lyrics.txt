Couplet 1
Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes your way


Couplet 2
I like some and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Wrestling with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under


Pont 
Yeah, darling, gonna make it happen 
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all the guns at once
And explode into space


Refrain
Like a  true nature child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild...
Born to be wild...
