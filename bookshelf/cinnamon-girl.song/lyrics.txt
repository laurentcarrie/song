couplet
I wanna live
with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy
the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl.


couplet
A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
You see us together,
chasing the moonlight,
My cinnamon girl.


couplet
Ten silver saxes,
a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes
and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl.


couplet 
A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
You see us together,
chasing the moonlight,
My cinnamon girl.

couplet
Pa sent me money now
I'm gonna make it somehow
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah...yeah...yeah.
