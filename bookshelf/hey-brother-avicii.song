couplet
I wanna live\n
with a cinnamon girl\n
I could be happy\n
the rest of my life\n
With a cinnamon girl.\n
}

\lyrics {
couplet
A dreamer of pictures\n
I run in the night\n
You see us together,\n
chasing the moonlight,\n
My cinnamon girl.\n
}

\lyrics {
couplet
Ten silver saxes,\n
a bass with a bow\n
The drummer relaxes\n
and waits between shows\n
For his cinnamon girl.\n

\lyrics {
couplet
Pa sent me money now\n
I'm gonna make it somehow\n
I need another chance\n
You see your baby loves to dance\n
Yeah...yeah...yeah.
