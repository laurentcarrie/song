couplet
Hey, Brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, Sister
Know the water's sweeet but blood is thicker
Oooh, when the sky comes falling down for you
there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.

Hey, [Bro]ther
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey, Sister
Do you still believe in love, I wonder
Oooh, when the sky comes falling down for you
there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Refrain
Aaaah, what if I'm far from home?
Oh, brother, I will hear your call
What if I lose it all?
Oh, sister, I will help you out.
Oooh, when the sky comes falling down for you
there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
