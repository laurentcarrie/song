couplet
Hey, Brother
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey, Sister
Know the water's sweeet but blood is thicker
Oooh, when the sky comes falling down for you
there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do.

Hey, Sister

Oooh, when the sky comes falling down for you
there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
