Couplet 1a
Just a perfect day
Drink Sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark,
We go home


Couplet 1b
Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie too,
And then home


Refrain
Oh, It's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on


Couplet 2a
Just a perfect day
Problems are left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun


Couplet 2b
Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good 


Final
You're going to reap just what you sow (X4)
